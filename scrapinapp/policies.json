Along with this policy, exists a procedure that is regularly maintained and provides detailed instructions on how the policy is followed. </p><p class=\"slate-p\">Access to systems at TrustCloud must be controlled to ensure only authorized users and applications can access customer and corporate data. Access and access controls must abide by the following principles:</p><ul class=\"slate-ul\"><li class=\"slate-li\"><div>Deny-by-default: Access must be denied by default. Gaining access requires an explicit step</div></li><li class=\"slate-li\">Least-privilege: Users and processes must be granted the lowest permission level necessary to perform their role</li><li class=\"slate-li\"><div>Auditability: Access grants are explicitly requested and approved, and an audit trail is persisted</div></li></ul><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Least-privilege access</h3><div data-control-id=\"b9f83186-766d-496d-bb7f-fb63fbb4cd6b\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">The Principle of Least Privilege states that a subject should be given only the privileges needed to complete their task or responsibility. If a subject does not need an access right, the subject should not have that right. In addition, the assignment of rights to a subject should be based on that subject&#x27;s function and role, rather than the subject&#x27;s identity or rank.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Each TrustCloud employee and contractor has limited access to TrustCloud systems, data and applications. Access is always provisioned to the minimum necessary for the individual to perform their duties and serve the business purpose of their role.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">The Principle of Least Privilege is applied not only to user accounts, but also to application-to-application service accounts, machine roles, operating system permissions, private interfaces, as well as the entire publicly-accessible surface of TrustCloud&#x27;s systems. Each permission context is reviewed to ensure that only the minimum required rights are granted.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">In order to refine access grants over time, and bolster the initial role-based approach, automated tools may be used to continuously monitor access privileges and flag unused ones to be reviewed for revocation.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">User Access Review</h3><div data-control-id=\"6138cdbe-72c7-4b57-be92-766dc668d0a6\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">Access reviews are not limited to sensitive systems, but are required for all systems administered by TrustCloud.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">The audit process shall verify that:</p><ul class=\"slate-ul\"><li class=\"slate-li\">All users in the system still have a business need for access</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Individual user permissions are set appropriately based on business needs</li><li class=\"slate-li\">For systems with role-based access control, access to resources is granted only through the appropriate role or group, and no user accounts are granted direct access</li><li class=\"slate-li\">All roles or groups are used, i.e. non-empty, and remove unused one.</li><li class=\"slate-li\"><div>External connections or third-party plugins still serve a business purpose, and are only granted the minimum access needed</div></li></ul><p class=\"slate-p\">Any deviation from the above checklist must be promptly resolved.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">All systems are reviewed quarterly.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Role-based access control</h3><div data-control-id=\"74f0407a-584b-4c0f-b0a5-f961c178697a\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">In a role-based access control approach, access to resources is determined based on roles that reflect a user&#x27;s set of responsibilities, rather than granted individually for each user. A role-based approach reduces permission customization, improves scalability as teams grow, reduces the likelihood of misconfigured permission settings, and simplifies the access review process.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">A default least-privilege role allows for easy onboarding of new users, and reduces the likelihood that users are granted more access than they need.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud employees are granted access to systems according to their role and their team.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">If a TrustCloud employee requires access outside of that provided by their role or team, the employee initiates an access request following the policy outlined in the \"requesting and approving access\" section.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Requesting and approving access</h3><div data-control-id=\"d97a7387-5eef-421b-8a65-af1321face7a\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">Initial access to systems is granted as part of the documented employee onboarding procedure. Access requests for new employees are typically filed by the employee. The ticket trail must contain an explicit approval by the owner&#x27;s manager.  For non-standard requests, approval by a director or higher is required to be documented on the ticket.</p><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">Temporary access</h4><p class=\"slate-p\">Additional access with privileges exceeding those necessitated by regular duties may be granted on a temporary basis. Each temporary access grant must be accompanied by a valid business purpose, such as an ongoing incident or an operational alert that may lead to an incident if not resolved.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">In all cases, access must be revoked immediately once the original business need for the grant no longer exists.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Temporary access grants must be treated as an exception and kept to a minimum. Recurring exceptions must be investigated, and the necessary tooling must be created to alleviate the need for repeated privilege escalation.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Termination process</h3><div data-control-id=\"67d1c8e3-d6d9-4272-8b75-dd92365aca75\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">To ensure access is revoked immediately, Human Resources or the manager of the departing employee or contractor must file an offboarding ticket as soon as access is no longer needed.</p><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">Role changes</h4><p class=\"slate-p\">An equivalent access revocation checklist is executed when employees change roles within TrustCloud. New roles may require substantially different access profiles, so it is important that such an event is handled consistently.</p><div data-variable-name=\"related-controls\"></div><div data-variable-name=\"approval-log\"></div>",

These controls assume that events such as accidental data corruption, deletion, or destruction will occur, and mitigate the impact of such events by maintaining reliable backup copies from which data can be readily restored.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Scope</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">This policy applies to all TrustCloud systems storing data classified as Customer Confidential, as defined in the Data Classification Policy.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Ownership</h2><p class=\"slate-p\"><span data-variable-name=\"owner\"></span> is responsible for implementing and maintaining this policy.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Policy Statement</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">The purpose of this policy is to define a set of rules or guidelines that TrustCloud and employees of TrustCloud must follow in order to achieve compliance. Along with this policy exists a procedure that is regularly maintained and provides detailed instructions on how the policy is followed.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Customer data stored on TrustCloud infrastructure is backed up in order to mitigate the impact of events such as:</p><ul class=\"slate-ul\"><li class=\"slate-li\">Accidental deletion by customer or employee</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Corruption of data due to software or human error</li><li class=\"slate-li\">General system failure</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Physical or environmental disaster at a data center site</li><li class=\"slate-li\">External attack resulting in stolen or ransomed data</li></ul><p class=\"slate-p\">In order to ensure timely and reliable restoration of data, TrustCloud backup and restore procedures are tested on a periodic basis. Data backups are protected with security equal or greater to that of the original system where said data was stored. Backup copies are retained for a sufficient period of time to ensure that data loss events can be mitigated even</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Backup Plan</h3><div data-control-id=\"59ef9abe-1e34-4121-a973-6449911a1edd\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">Full backups of TrustCloud production databases are performed daily. Where available, database transaction logs are enabled and retained to support point-in-time recovery.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Customer data stored in cloud filestores such as S3 may be backed up using those systems&#x27; built-in versioning capabilities. Versioned systems record version history for each stored object, and offer the ability to restore that object to any previously saved state. Versioning is typically simpler to operate and more cost-efficient than full backup snapshots, especially for file objects that change less frequently.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Restore Testing</h3><div data-control-id=\"95e6069a-c838-4933-b49d-fd40a5f26c20\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">On their own, regularly performed backups are not a sufficient mitigator of data loss events. It is possible that, over time, backed-up data and the method used to perform backups drift relative to the rest of the system. As a result of such drift, available backup copies may become unusable, or require extended database recovery times in order to correct the differences.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">To safeguard against this possibility, TrustCloud performs quarterly testing of its backup restoration process.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Backup Storage</h3><div data-control-id=\"da3f3a60-b440-4566-946c-4c0480f6e10d\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">Backup copies of Customer Sensitive data contain all customer information that was present in the original system. Therefore, it is critical that these artifacts have the same or greater level of protection as that of data in the original system.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Access to backup artifacts is limited to individuals or systems involved in restore testing, as well as infrastructure administrators. Backups at rest must be encrypted with the same encryption as the original data store from which they were created.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">To ensure the resilience of TrustCloud data, it is critical for backups to be resilient to local data center issues. As such, backup copies are only stored on fault-tolerant systems offering high availability, or are replicated across multiple geographically-disparate cloud regions.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Backup Retention</h3><div data-control-id=\"f094faf6-0dd3-4448-8fb7-7c87734eabf1\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">Full backup copies are retained for a minimum of 30 days, or longer as required by customer agreements or regulatory requirements. The same retention window applies to cloud filestore backups performed using versioning.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Backup copies older than the retention window are promptly deleted by TrustCloud using the cloud provider&#x27;s default secure deletion method or, when they can be configured to do so, automatically expire and are securely deleted by the cloud provider.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Transaction logs used for point-in-time recovery may be retained for a shorter window than that of full backups, resulting in a potential Recovery Point Objective increase.  For more information, see the Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Policy.</p><div data-variable-name=\"related-controls\"></div><div data-variable-name=\"approval-log\"></div>",

        "template": "<h1 class=\"slate-h1\">Authentication and Password Policy</h1><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Purpose</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">This policy describes TrustCloud&#x27;s requirements with regards to account authentication, including how passwords should be generated, used, and protected.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Scope</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">The policy applies to all employees and contractors, and the accounts they use in connection with fulfilling their responsibilities to TrustCloud.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Ownership</h2><p class=\"slate-p\"><span data-variable-name=\"owner\"></span> is responsible for implementing and maintaining this policy.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Policy Statement</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">The purpose of this policy is to define a set of rules or guidelines that TrustCloud and employees of TrustCloud must follow in order to achieve compliance. Along with this policy exists a procedure that is regularly maintained and provides detailed instructions on how the policy is followed.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">The overall intent of the policy is to ensure that employees use strong credentials, leverage Single Sign-on (SSO) to reduce the need to maintain one set of credentials for each system, store them securely, and use Multi-factor authentication (MFA) at least for the most sensitive systems.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Single sign-on (SSO)</h3><div data-control-id=\"f20200f7-8132-4f9e-bb0b-e0c3b8df5082\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud&#x27;s main Identity Provider is used as its SSO provider.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">SSO usage reduces risk by centralizing authentication requirements and enforcement points. It improves employee productivity by reducing the number of credentials they must manage.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Multi-factor authentication (MFA)</h3><div data-control-id=\"780e6e7d-6484-4552-8fad-7185e8f3e397\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">Multi-factor (or two-factor) authentication (MFA) has been designated as the preferred method of authentication by NIST (800-63 Digital Identity Guidelines <a href=\"https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/\" class=\"slate-a\">https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/</a>) since 2017. MFA strengthens security by requiring at least one additional factor, in addition to a password, to verify identity. The additional factor is something the user has (such as their phone) or something they are (such as their fingerprint). Since a password is no longer the only means of authentication, and since these other factors are inherently different in nature from memorized secrets, MFA significantly increases the difficulty bar for executing a successful attack. In addition, by not relying solely on password verification for authentication, MFA eliminates the need for periodic password rotation and reduces password fatigue.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Multi-factor authentication is, at a minimum, required for all systems classified to contain sensitive data as per the Data Classification Policy, and strongly recommended for all other systems.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">MFA support is a requirement for the adoption of new systems expected to store sensitive data.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">For systems storing customer PII and other regulated data, MFA must be enforced: users should not be able to disable the second factor and retain access to these systems, and access to these systems without a second factor should not be possible.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Password management tool</h3><div data-control-id=\"056817b5-85f2-488c-82eb-62778414773a\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">Password management software improves both convenience and security. A master password is more likely to be long and unique, since only that password needs to be remembered in order for the user to gain easy access to all their other other accounts and passwords.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">In addition, password managers facilitate generating and using passwords that are unique for each account and significantly stronger than those the typical human can remember.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">A user&#x27;s master password should be memorized and never recorded or shared. Since a password management system is only as secure as the master password used to unlock it, this password should be as long as possible, and should never be reused.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Some password managers also allow secure sharing of credentials, for cases where unique credentials are not required or available. While unique credentials are always preferred, using these sharing mechanisms is encouraged over sharing credentials through other, less secure channels.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Unique User IDs</h3><p class=\"slate-p\">Individual accounts are required for access to systems storing or processing sensitive information. Unique IDs allow for granular, least-privilege access which minimizes the impact of any single compromised user account. They also improve accountability since every action in an audit trail can be directly associated with a unique individual.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">User IDs and passwords are used to control access to TrustCloud systems and may not be disclosed to any other employee for any reason.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Sharing of credentials is only permitted for systems storing data with low sensitivity as per the Data Classification Policy, or upon the explicit approval of the Security Officer. Access must still be restricted to the smallest teams and there must be an established business needs. Any shared credentials must be rotated upon the departure of any employee in the share group. Sharing is best done using a Password Management system or a secure password vault.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Password Configurations</h3><div data-control-id=\"351c2ffc-d4de-4880-bf3c-3110a53ae685\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud&#x27;s Password Configuration policy is based on NIST Special Publication 800-63B version 4 (<a href=\"https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html\" class=\"slate-a\">https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-4/sp800-63b.html</a>). TrustCloud defines strong passwords as follows:</p><ul class=\"slate-ul\"><li class=\"slate-li\">Having minimum length of 12 characters, maximum length not shorter than 64 characters.</li><li class=\"slate-li\"><div>Allow multiple character types, such as numbers, uppercase, lowercase, and special characters, though these are not required and should not be enforced, and longer passwords are preferred over more complex ones.</div></li><li class=\"slate-li\"><div>\"Longer is stronger\". Length is ultimately the biggest contributing factor to password strength. Longer passwords have a greater number of possible combinations, thus making them harder to brute-force.</div></li><li class=\"slate-li\"><div>Not appearing in a list of commonly-known weak passwords. One such list is maintained at <a href=\"https://cry.github.io/nbp/\" class=\"slate-a\">https://cry.github.io/nbp/</a>.</div></li></ul><p class=\"slate-p\">Strong passwords are required for all systems classified to contain sensitive data as per the Data Classification Policy, and strongly recommended for all other systems.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">The ability to enforce or monitor for strong passwords is a requirement for the adoption of new systems expected to store sensitive data.</p><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">Password handling</h4><p class=\"slate-p\">Password storage must be encrypted, or salted and hashed using cryptographically strong algorithms and multiple rounds. Passwords should not be written down physically (in notebooks, sticky notes, etc) or be stored unencrypted on any device.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Passwords must not be emailed or sent via other messaging and communication methods. Initial passwords for new accounts are exempt from this rule, but must be changed by the new account holder on first use, as detailed below.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Passwords submitted for authentication purposes must only be transmitted via encrypted channels.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Passwords may not be reused across multiple accounts, including between personal and work accounts. Any reused passwords increase the impact of a single compromised account.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Users who believe their account has been compromised are required to immediately reset their password and promptly report the incident to the Security Officer. Breached credentials must be changed and never used again.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">In systems where a password is automatically generated upon account creation or password reset, the user is required to change their temporary password to a permanent one upon first login. To reduce the risk of a complete set of temporary credentials falling into the wrong hands, each part of the credential (password, email, username, etc) must be communicated out-of-band and in a separate channel.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Any pre-existing default passwords must be changed upon first use.</p><div data-variable-name=\"related-controls\"></div><div data-variable-name=\"approval-log\"></div>",

        "template": "<h1 class=\"slate-h1\">Encryption Policy</h1><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Purpose</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">The purpose of this policy is to establish practices for protecting TrustCloud data in the event of unauthorized access through the use of encryption. The policy describes the different components that can be configured to utilize encryption, the algorithm that must be used for each, and how encryption keys should be managed.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Scope</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">The policy applies to all systems that store or process TrustCloud data classified as Customer Confidential as per the Data Classification Policy.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Ownership</h2><p class=\"slate-p\"><span data-variable-name=\"owner\"></span> is responsible for implementing and maintaining this policy.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Policy Statement</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">The purpose of this policy is to define a set of rules or guidelines that TrustCloud and employees of TrustCloud must follow in order to achieve compliance. Along with this policy exists a procedure that is regularly maintained and provides detailed instructions on how the policy is followed.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">All sensitive data classified according to TrustCloud&#x27;s Data Classification policy is encrypted at rest and in transit using strong, industry-recommended algorithms. Encryption at rest is used across multiple systems and layers of the stack including file systems, file object stores, databases, third-party SaaS services, and directly in TrustCloud&#x27;s own developed components. Encryption in motion is primarily achieved through the use of Transport Layer Security (TLS), but may include other secure protocols.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">File store encryption</h3><div data-control-id=\"3aa1f7b3-6b8f-45c3-9391-d3700a5d816b\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">All TrustCloud files stored in S3 are encrypted using industry-standard AES-256 encryption with AWS-managed keys. S3 encrypts each object on the server, using a unique key, and then further encrypts the keys themselves with a master key stored in AWS KMS.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">File systems encryption</h3><div data-control-id=\"09e873bc-3817-41bb-8f41-99578f5995e7\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud encrypts all data volumes on AWS using AWS EBS encryption. This solution applies encryption at rest on a block-level, and encryption in transit between the data volume and the compute instance. The algorithm used is industry-standard AES-256. The key used is stored alongside the data, but encrypted on-disk using a master key stored in AWS KMS.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Data store encryption</h3><div data-control-id=\"c00845da-2485-45b7-8bcc-96efceefb3e2\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">Data stored in TrustCloud&#x27;s AWS RDS instances, as well as its automated backups and snapshots, is encrypted using industry-standard AES-256. Encryption keys are AWS-managed, stored in AWS KMS, and key usage is audited.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Key management</h3><div data-control-id=\"241edca3-8fef-496d-935a-987e924f00c4\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">As specified in TrustCloud&#x27;s Data Classification Policy, encryption keys are classified at the same level as the data they protect. As such, keys must be stored in a secure, encrypted key store. User and application access to keys should be limited to cases that fulfill a business need.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">At TrustCloud, the preferred storage solution for symmetric and asymmetric encryption keys is AWS KMS. AWS KMS is a special-purpose key storage service that uses FIPS 140-2 validated hardware security modules to protect encryption keys. Encryption, decryption, and key management processes are inspected and verified internally by AWS on a regular basis, as part of an existing internal validation process.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Encryption keys that are suspected to be compromised must be reported immediately to <span data-variable-name=\"owner\"></span> and scheduled for immediate rotation.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">TLS certificates and endpoints</h3><div data-control-id=\"9fb61055-3c69-41ee-93cb-60b2ac392e60\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">Strong encryption of data in transit based on TLS requires up-to-date cipher suites on any TLS-enabled endpoints. The list of suite components that must be kept updated includes the TLS version, configuration options, as well as available algorithms and key lengths. Critical vulnerabilities in older SSL and TLS versions, such as the Beast and Poodle attacks, as well as subsequent deprecations of TLS v1.0 and v1.1 over the past several years, have made securing TLS termination endpoints a necessary major focus of any strong security program.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud maintains a secure and updated configuration of its TLS endpoint, and performs continuous external tests. A passing test requires TLS v1.2 or higher, and AES-128 or higher.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Data in transit encryption</h3><div data-control-id=\"5383e7cb-4a30-46cb-ad54-0e8bc6f686f2\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">All public interfaces must only be accessible over secure ports and protocols, such as TLS and ssh. TrustCloud performs continuous testing to ensure that ports associated with plain-text protocols, such as port 80 for http, are closed. All communication between clients and TrustCloud&#x27;s network components and applications is encrypted with AES-256 to ensure any accidental or malicious exposure of a communication channel is unreadable to unauthorized parties.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Data in transit encryption at TrustCloud is applied universally to all data, without consideration of that data&#x27;s classification or its status as Sensitive or Regulated.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Cryptography</h3><div data-control-id=\"40a0acab-763d-4188-a0d5-7801bdf23cdc\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud does not use any custom, \"roll your own\" encryption frameworks. Custom cryptography carries many risks and it is to be avoided. Only established community implementations of industry-standard algorithms, such as AES-256 for symmetric encryption or bcrypt for hashing, may be used.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Use of encryption in source code requires a design review, a code review, and final approval by <span data-variable-name=\"owner\"></span> or appropriate Engineering approver.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Application passwords are never stored in plain text. They are salted and hashed using the approved algorithm, and the hashed value and salt are stored securely along with other customer data. The main configuration option for hashing algorithms is their number of iterations, sometimes known as the \"work factor\", which controls the amount of time spent performing each hashing operation. NIST recommends that this setting be high enough to result in a purposefully slow hashing process, in order to reduce the viability of brute-force attack attempts. A precise formula for calculating the ideal work factor is difficult to offer, but as a rough benchmark, the algorithm should be configured such that the duration of each operation is around 1000ms on a modern 2.4GHz CPU. The number of iterations must be doubled every 18 months to account for Moore&#x27;s law, which predicts that computing power will double over that same period.</p><div data-variable-name=\"related-controls\"></div><div data-variable-name=\"approval-log\"></div>",

        "template": "<h1 class=\"slate-h1\">Business Continuity Policy</h1><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Purpose</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">The purpose of this policy is to establish requirements and plans to recover TrustCloud operations following a disruption due to causes such as natural disaster, loss of access to premises, pandemic, or malicious activity from external or internal sources.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Scope</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">This policy applies to all TrustCloud systems determined to be of critical importance to the business, as described in the Impact Analysis</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Ownership</h2><p class=\"slate-p\"><span data-variable-name=\"owner\"></span> is responsible for implementing and maintaining this policy.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Policy Statement</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">The purpose of this policy is to define a set of rules or guidelines that TrustCloud and employees of TrustCloud must follow in order to achieve compliance. Along with this policy, exists a procedure in Notion  that is regularly maintained and provides detailed instructions on how the policy is followed.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud employs continuity planning and disaster recovery to enable the continuous operation of its product(s) without unacceptable interruptions or data loss. TrustCloud establishes plans and technical measures that are commensurate with the complexity and risk of each component, taking into account its function and data.</p><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">Business Continuity</h4><h5 class=\"slate-h5\">Impact Analysis</h5><p class=\"slate-p\">As part of its continuity planning, TrustCloud performs analysis of its systems and assets classified according to the Data Classification Policy, and determines the criticality of each component to the business. This analysis is performed annually, or upon significant architectural changes or additions of new key vendors.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Critical systems are systems that store Customer Confidential data, as well as those that are deemed business-critical by the team. For each critical system, TrustCloud determines impact and risk, and plans contingencies accordingly.</p><h5 class=\"slate-h5\">Business location</h5><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud&#x27;s operations do not require access to a physical office. Company employees are fully equipped and empowered to work from home and perform all business critical functions, including developing and operating its products, and communicating with each other as well as with customers. Further information on home office security is available in the Physical Security Policy, and Authentication and Password Policy.</p><h5 class=\"slate-h5\">Data Backups</h5><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud data backups are stored, retained and tested as described in the Backup Policy and all related backup controls. </p><h5 class=\"slate-h5\">Data Centers</h5><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud uses established Infrastructure-as-a-Service cloud providers to procure the necessary infrastructure required to meet its business objectives. These cloud vendors provide and manage best-in-class data centers that offer asset management, redundant power and networks, and physical security. The company employs security controls to govern its obligations as part of the shared responsibility model required by each cloud provider.</p><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">Contingency Planning</h4><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud&#x27;s operating infrastructure consists of 3 main parts:</p><ul class=\"slate-ul\"><li class=\"slate-li\">Cloud environment hosting &#x27;s product</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Physical office(s)</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Critical third-party vendors</li></ul><h5 class=\"slate-h5\">Cloud environment</h5><p class=\"slate-p\">As mentioned in the \"Data Centers provided by Cloud Providers\"</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Disaster Recovery Plan</h3><div data-control-id=\"b1c8b8a6-a5ba-4bc7-bb3d-c1d7de6a085e\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\"></p><span data-variable-name=\"owner\"></span> is responsible for managing any disaster recovery efforts by following the plan outlined herein.<p class=\"slate-p\">The Disaster Recovery plan outlines the main stages that TrustCloud follows to bring its systems back online following a major disruption. The exact actions performed in each phase will differ depending on the type of the disruption, but following this plan will facilitate  consistency, clear communication, and minimization of impact.</p><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">Phase 1: Declaration and notification</h4><p class=\"slate-p\">A disaster is declared when it becomes clear that an ongoing disruption or outage will significantly exceed the standard time required to resolve an incident. Since exact definitions are hard to formalize, the incident manager and their team of subject-matter experts (SMEs) must determine on a case-by-case basis whether to move into the Recovery phase of the plan, or whether to wait for the issue to be resolved following TrustClouds standard resolution strategy.</p><p class=\"slate-p\"></p><span data-variable-name=\"owner\"></span> is responsible for leading disaster recovery efforts, involving any necessary SMEs, and communicating to business stakeholders.<h4 class=\"slate-h4\">Phase 2: Recovery</h4><p class=\"slate-p\">The Recovery phase consists of the steps required to create a new production environment and divert traffic to it.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">If the original cloud region is experiencing degraded performance or is otherwise unavailable, the new environment may be created in a different region.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">In order to prepare for this phase, TrustCloud maintains:</p><ul class=\"slate-ul\"><li class=\"slate-li\">Infrastructure scripts and code for creating a new production environment, including the creation and configuration of networks, accounts, databases, and any computing clusters</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Access to sufficient backup copies to satisfy the required Recovery Time Objective</li><li class=\"slate-li\">An ability to update DNS records to point to a new environment</li></ul><p class=\"slate-p\">Explicit procedures to recover and validate individual components belong with the component&#x27;s internal documentation, and are not outlined in this policy.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">After all components are restored, testing is performed to ensure that the new environment is fully functional, before making it accessible for customers. As a final step, the team communicates resolution to all affected customers using the appropriate channels.</p><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">Phase 3: Retrospective</h4><p class=\"slate-p\">The Retrospective phase establishes a blame-free environment that allows all parties to gain a clear understanding of the incident and its resolution. A retrospective meeting should occur within 1 week of a disaster recovery event.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Retrospective meetings must definitively outline the root case and response timeline, along with any lessons, as well as action items for improving tooling, process, and software. Following the meeting, a retrospective report outlining key items should be created and shared with all participants and relevant stakeholders. Depending on customer impact, a customer-facing version of the report may be created and shared with customers as required by legal obligations and customer agreements.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Disaster Recovery Testing</h3><div data-control-id=\"0a184fe9-4a3b-48e7-9235-cf3f68ed0512\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">A disaster recovery test with predefined Recovery Time Objective (RTO) and Recovery Point Objective (RPO) goals is performed annually, assuming a full outage of the primary cloud region.  TrustCloud has established and RTO goal of 12 hours and an RPO goal of 10 minutes.  </p><p class=\"slate-p\">Disaster recovery testing is essential for ensuring TrustCloud&#x27;s readiness to stay within its RTO and RPO goals, and for confirming TrustCloud&#x27;s ability to both act and communicate quickly both internally and externally.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">The main DR capability of TrustCloud is the ability to create a new production environment from scratch, potentially in a separate cloud region, and seeding it with a restore of previously backed up production data.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">This capability has two requirements:</p><ul class=\"slate-ul\"><li class=\"slate-li\">Data backups are sufficiently isolated from the regular production infrastructure boundary. If backups are stored along with the data, then the attacker or an accident can affect both. Sufficient isolation requires that the backups are stored in a separate physical region, under a separate cloud account with a different set of account credentials.</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Infrastructure setup is maintained as code or equivalent procedural documentation exists, to ensure a speedy recovery in an automated or scripted fashion.</li></ul><p class=\"slate-p\">This capability addresses disaster scenarios such as:</p><ul class=\"slate-ul\"><li class=\"slate-li\">Ransomware and cyberattacks</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Unintentionally erased databases, files or folders/buckets</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Prolonged datacenter outage</li></ul><p class=\"slate-p\">Due to its distributed workforce, TrustCloud&#x27;s operations are well protected against pandemics, because all employees are equipped to securely work from home.</p><div data-variable-name=\"related-controls\"></div><div data-variable-name=\"approval-log\"></div>",

Along with this policy exists a procedure that is regularly maintained and provides detailed instructions on how the policy is followed.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Incident Management Plan</h3><div data-control-id=\"40fe9254-2294-4fc0-8d13-a354626d646f\"></div><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">Team Members</h4><p class=\"slate-p\">As the policy owner, <span data-variable-name=\"owner\"></span> shall identify members of the incident response teams and direct their roles and responsibilities during an active incident.</p><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">Response Steps</h4><p class=\"slate-p\">The security team triages employee-reported and alert-generated security events, and  assigns them either normal, high, or critical severity. </p><h5 class=\"slate-h5\">Phase 1: Declaration and Notification</h5><p class=\"slate-p\">The declaration phase is focused on investigating whether the reported issue represents an actual or imminent incident. During this phase, the team gains a clear understanding of the nature of the event, and determines whether to declare an incident or dismiss the event as a false positive.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Unlike availability and uptime incidents, security incidents are not immediately announced to the whole company. Instead, communication is on a need-to-know basis, and only relevant business stakeholders and individuals whose expertise can aid the investigation are informed of the incident&#x27;s details, as determined by the incident manager.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">At this stage, all other employees may only be told that a security incident is ongoing, at the discretion of the CISO. </p><h5 class=\"slate-h5\">Phase 2: Diagnosis</h5><p class=\"slate-p\">The incident response team conducts detailed diagnosis to pinpoint the root cause of the incident.  Relevant teams are involved to diagnose issues.  Tools such as Google Meet and Slack are used to collaborate real-time in order to solve the issue quickly.  </p><h5 class=\"slate-h5\">Phase 3: Containment</h5><p class=\"slate-p\">Measures are implemented to prevent the incident from spreading or worsening (e.g., isolating affected systems).  Temporary fixes or patches to affected systems may be applied to allow continued operation or limit the spread of the incident.  Any necessary changes must follow the emergency change control process.  </p><h5 class=\"slate-h5\">Phase 4: Resolution</h5><p class=\"slate-p\">The root cause of the incident is determined and the threat or issue is eliminated from the environment.  Defenses are strenghtened to prevent recurrence (e.g., apply patches, enhance security configurations).  Any necessary changes must follow the emergency change control process.  </p><h5 class=\"slate-h5\">Phase 5: Recovery</h5><p class=\"slate-p\">Affected systems are restored to normal operation, and are monitored to ensure no residual threats or issues remain.  The integrity of systems and data are verified, and the incident is closed.  </p><h5 class=\"slate-h5\">Phase 6: Root Cause Analysis, and post-mortem and prevention</h5><p class=\"slate-p\">A post-mortem review is scheduled by the incident manager to evaluate the response.  A post-mortem meeting should occur within 1 week of an incident.  The post-mortem should be a blame-free environment, focused on documenting the incident root cause, response timeline, impact analysis, lessons learned, and areas for improvement with action items and timelines.  Tickets may be created for future work, and/or procedures may be updated to mitigate future incidents of this type.  Possible risks are considered to be added to the risk register, if applicable.  All identified changes follow the normal change control process.  </p><p class=\"slate-p\">The incident must be reported to the relevant law enforcement agency and/or customers if required by contractual or regulatory obligations. The team must receive legal counsel prior to reporting.  </p><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">Documentation and Metrics</h4><p class=\"slate-p\"><span data-variable-name=\"owner\"></span> ensures that all relevant information is verified and logged in TrustCloud&#x27;s project management tool. TrustCloud tracks the numbers, types, response times, resolution times, and cost of incidents over time in order to surface any trends across the business.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Security Incident - Testing</h3><div data-control-id=\"75fff74d-1261-4f67-b963-fcb5cb9c5bef\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">NIST recommends that the testing process include both technical tests as well as tabletop testing exercises, in which team members meet in an informal, classroom setting to discuss their roles during an emergency and their responses to a particular situation, and a facilitator guides participants through a discussion of one or more scenarios. Incident testing should be followed by a retrospective meeting that produces both lessons and action items similar to those produced by a real event.</p><div data-variable-name=\"related-controls\"></div><div data-variable-name=\"approval-log\"></div>",

Since any product development carries additional risk, it is imperative that TrustCloud follow a well-defined process to ensure that sufficient checks and balances are in place to mitigate this risk.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Scope</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">The policy covers changes to TrustCloud&#x27;s production systems, as well as to related tools classified as Customer Confidential as per the Data Classification Policy.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Outside of the scope of this policy are changes such as:</p><ul class=\"slate-ul\"><li class=\"slate-li\">Changes in development environments</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Internal document updates</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Routine IT changes such as fixing a computer or a printer</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Management of user access to various systems, which is subject to the Access Control policy</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Resolution of data or configuration issues for a particular customer as a result of a support ticket</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Data changes resulting from the use of a established, special-purpose tools or user interfaces</li></ul><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Ownership</h2><p class=\"slate-p\"><span data-variable-name=\"owner\"></span> is responsible for implementing and maintaining this policy.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Policy Statement</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">The purpose of this policy is to define a set of rules or guidelines that TrustCloud and employees of TrustCloud must follow in order to achieve compliance. Along with this policy exists a procedure that is regularly maintained and provides detailed instructions on how the policy is followed.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud performs changes on its production systems by following the Change Management Policy outlined in this document and related procedures.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Infrastructure-as-code</h3><div data-control-id=\"127e5fb1-f0ba-4351-9769-ae1340b35fd3\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">Infrastructure-as-code is the process of configuring infrastructure through the use of scripts or declarative configuration files, as opposed to manual configuration via interactive configuration tools. Infrastructure code is stored in source control, alongside application code, enabling the same tracking, review and approval processes that are followed by application code.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">This approach greatly decreases the risk of human error by creating repeatable processes, and improves development velocity, capacity management responsiveness, and Disaster Recovery  due to fewer manual steps required to configure and provision systems.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Change Management Workflow</h3><div data-control-id=\"4b149b2d-2b2b-419c-8844-066301a74e80\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud maintains a detailed change management procedure. The procedure describes the processes followed as changes flow from development to production, including:</p><ul class=\"slate-ul\"><li class=\"slate-li\">How changes are developed within a development environment</li><li class=\"slate-li\">How changes are tested, including unit, integration, end-to-end, manual, load, and acceptance testing</li><li class=\"slate-li\">How changes are documented and communicated internally and externally</li><li class=\"slate-li\">How changes are reviewed, including a feedback process leading to eventual approval</li><li class=\"slate-li\">How changes are deployed</li><li class=\"slate-li\">How changes are monitored post deployment and reverted if needed</li></ul><p class=\"slate-p\">To support the business goal of high development velocity at low risk, TrustCloud&#x27;s change management procedure is maintained as a living document, and is continuously updated.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">The documented change management procedure is maintained in TrustCloud. Following best practices, many aspects of the procedure are automated, and as such, do not require additional documentation aside from that which is already a part of their implementation.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">By default, performing any step outlined in the change management workflow results in the creation of a log entry for auditing and improvement purposes. Such steps include test runs, the approval flow, and the execution of deployment commands.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Change Management Approvals</h3><div data-control-id=\"d067d357-e6c0-4160-a1fb-df8d46a71145\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">Before any new code change is merged into the code base, it must be submitted for review as a pull/merge request. A detailed overview of the code review process is part of TrustCloud&#x27;s internal development process documentation.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">A code review is typically performed after any relevant automated tests have passed, to ensure that the reviewer&#x27;s time is efficiently allocated.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Depending on the component being changed and the criticality of the change, a review may require approval from multiple individuals.</p><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">Emergency changes</h4><p class=\"slate-p\">During an active incident involving downtime, performance degradation, or a security issue, some workflow checks and reviews may be expedited in order to fast-track the change and patch the ongoing issue. Any such incidents must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis, and require the explicit approval of the incident manager.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Commonly, any workflow steps skipped as a result of an emergency change must be completed retroactively once the incident has been resolved.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Change Management - Tracking</h3><div data-control-id=\"304a059a-90a5-473e-aea4-04bc76758984\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud uses a project management tool to plan changes and new development work. Work is represented as tickets of various types, such as user stories, bug fixes, and quality improvements. Tickets are prioritized by the respective teams and scheduled in product iterations.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Source code is stored in a version control system. Integrations are configured to cross-reference new code with work tickets in order to promote traceability between business requirements and code changes.</p><div data-variable-name=\"related-controls\"></div><div data-variable-name=\"approval-log\"></div>",

Information system logs are also a key prerequisite for incident response and remediation.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud systems classified as Customer Confidential generate audit logs, record access events and capture a number of key pieces of information:</p><ul class=\"slate-ul\"><li class=\"slate-li\">Timestamp</li><li class=\"slate-li\">The identity of the user or system making the request</li><li class=\"slate-li\">The type of event or action taken, such as GET/PUT or read/write</li><li class=\"slate-li\">The resource on which the action is attempted</li><li class=\"slate-li\">The outcome (e.g. success, failure)</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Information about the client (e.g. IP address and a user-agent string of the software program making the request)</li></ul><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Logging of Administrative actions</h3><div data-control-id=\"80d9eba1-49e9-4978-b10d-d65f634557f9\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud has stronger requirements for audit logging when the user is a privileged administrator. Administrators typically have elevated access, and as such, a rogue administrator has the capability to cover their tracks. All logs are sent to a cloud logging provider, and logs cannot be deleted or altered.  In addition, all access to sensitive systems is managed by a Priviledge Access Management system, which is audited and logged.  This helps ensure that logs are protected against tampering, even by administrators.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Centralized Logging</h3><div data-control-id=\"702bbf02-042b-44d7-8ca7-789fec172eab\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud uses a specialized logging service to store audit logs. Using a logging service ensures that logs are shipped away from the system in which they were generated, and as such are further protected from users with privileged access to that system. In addition, storing logs in a single central location allows for easier access management , helping to ensure only authorized users with a business need can view logs. By default, logs are transmitted using channels encrypted with TLS or equivalent.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">The retention period of audit logs is managed centrally on the logging service. The retention period is governed by applicable legal, regulatory, contractual and business requirements. Logs that go past their retention period are automatically deleted by the logging service.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">If a very long retention period is required by business or legal reasons, audit logs older than a certain window may be archived to a low-cost storage location. Archived logs are stored on a cloud provider, with equivalent encryption strength and further restricted access control.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Retention periods for audit logs are specified in TrustCloud&#x27;s Data Retention Procedure.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Security Event Logging</h3><div data-control-id=\"aee2ee37-fb12-4789-8479-23588315c56b\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">Owners of systems classified as Customer Confidential should ensure that their components log security-related events, such as:</p><ul class=\"slate-ul\"><li class=\"slate-li\">User account creation</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Session creation attempts</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Modification of permission sets</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Privilege elevation (if applicable)</li><li class=\"slate-li\">User impersonation (if applicable)</li></ul><p class=\"slate-p\">In addition, system owners should work to identify other security-related events specific to their component, and ensure that the appropriate logging or alert mechanism is employed to record or communicate their occurrence.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">When possible, TrustCloud uses automated tools to monitor for additional suspicious activity, such as changes in network traffic and data access patterns, requests from known malicious IP addresses, and requests with known malicious signatures. These tools are configured to send alerts, which are reviewed based on priority.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Security Event Review</h3><div data-control-id=\"070dbd3b-97c2-4832-a4e9-86bf921a2dbc\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">When possible, TrustCloud uses automated tools to escalate and triage security events in real-time. </p><p class=\"slate-p\">Any suspected malicious activity, or unauthorized or inadvertent disclosure, will be treated as a potential Security Incident, and managed as described in the Security Incident Management Policy.</p><div data-variable-name=\"related-controls\"></div><div data-variable-name=\"approval-log\"></div>",

It also applies to employee-owned devices used to access company information.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Ownership</h2><p class=\"slate-p\"><span data-variable-name=\"owner\"></span> is responsible for implementing and maintaining this policy.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Policy Statement</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">The purpose of this policy is to define a set of rules or guidelines that TrustCloud and employees of TrustCloud must follow in order to achieve compliance. Along with this policy, exists a procedure in Notion  that is regularly maintained and provides detailed instructions on how the policy is followed. </p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Asset types</h3><div data-control-id=\"3fb3173e-d68c-41ad-9985-9bfa458504fd\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud workstations and other IT assets must be hardened before use, and maintained such that they remain in a hardened state.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">To accomplish this, TrustCloud maintains a hardening checklist for each asset type, which outlines the safeguards for keeping systems secure. This ensures that the same hardware is configured securely in an identical, predictable fashion. This list may include, but is not limited to:</p><li class=\"slate-li\">Enabling full disk encryption</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Enabling operating system-level firewalls</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Enabling biometric and strong passwords</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Configuring auto-locking and screen saver activation</li><p class=\"slate-p\">Hardening requirements may be implemented and maintained either manually, by each employee, or automatically, via an Endpoint Management solution.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Deviations from the standard configuration should be documented and approved by <span data-variable-name=\"owner\"></span>, and must only take place when there is a valid business need to do so.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Inventory</h3><div data-control-id=\"370600f7-b275-4899-8a15-cacca3aeff78\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">Maintaining a complete asset inventory is necessary for keeping IT assets and the data they access and process secure. While TrustCloud considers its employees&#x27; workstations its most critical physical assets to inventory, it may additionally track other asset types, such as company-provided mobile devices or networking office equipment. <span data-variable-name=\"owner\"></span> is responsible for maintaining an inventory of these assets using automated or manual means.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Each asset in the inventory is assigned an owner, typically representing its primary user. The asset owner is responsible for complying with relevant sections of the Acceptable Use and Asset Management policies. If an asset is reassigned to another employee, the asset&#x27;s ownership record should be updated to reflect this change.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Company-owned IT assets which do not process or access customer data, such as printers or scanners, have no impact on data security and as such may be excluded from the inventory.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Workstations - malware</h3><div data-control-id=\"f2efbd82-8f5a-498c-85c9-0266edd0c87c\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">Anti-malware/anti-virus software is installed and maintained on all workstations governed by this control. The software must be from an established vendor, and must demonstrate consistent results in recognizing and removing different types of malware.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Workstations - OS</h3><div data-control-id=\"becc7006-1f8d-4446-8424-0220306a996a\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud leverages a monitoring tool to ensure IT assets are secure and compliant. The tool can either actively manage and enforce compliance at the endpoint, passively report an endpoint&#x27;s compliance status, or disallow endpoint access from non-compliant devices.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Requirements monitored include data and settings such as:</p><ul class=\"slate-ul\"><li class=\"slate-li\"><div>Full disk encryption status</div></li><li class=\"slate-li\"><div>Operating system-level firewall configuration</div></li><li class=\"slate-li\"><div>Biometric and strong password enforcement</div></li><li class=\"slate-li\"><div>Current operating system version</div></li></ul><p class=\"slate-p\"></p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Asset Disposal</h3><div data-control-id=\"6e5dbf6a-2757-4a89-a085-7df725842483\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">When technology assets have reached the end of their useful life, proper disposal should be ensured in accordance to a procedure for the asset type that is approved by the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO). The procedure must include:</p><ul class=\"slate-ul\"><li class=\"slate-li\"><div>Removal of all company data from the device and sanitization utilizing industry-standard methods for secure erasure</div></li><li class=\"slate-li\"><div>A preference for recycling the asset if possible, or destruction of the asset otherwise</div></li></ul><p class=\"slate-p\">All destroyed assets should be documented in the company&#x27;s asset management tool or ticketing system.  </p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Mobile device policy</h3><div data-control-id=\"d0ef92b0-81bc-45ba-850d-33312db01cd7\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">The use of mobile devices, such as smartphones, for business purposes has long been perceived to increase a company’s risk level. Modern smartphones and tablets, however, provide many strong security features, such as biometric authentication and the ability to execute a remote data wipe. Today, a properly secured mobile device may even be used to increase security, by way of providing a second authentication factor when accessing sensitive systems.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Mobile Devices are not intended for, and may not be used for, directly accessing production infrastructure and sensitive or regulated customer data.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Employees may use mobile devices or personally-owned equipment to access resources such as:</p><ul class=\"slate-ul\"><li class=\"slate-li\"><div>Messaging services such as Slack</div></li><li class=\"slate-li\"><div>Email and office applications such as Google Workspace</div></li><li class=\"slate-li\"><div>Multi-factor authentication apps</div></li></ul><p class=\"slate-p\">Devices must be password-protected using at least a six-character PIN, and the biometric feature of the device. The automatic default screen lock on inactivity should not be relaxed past their factory defaults. Employees should promptly install operating system security updates onto their devices if asked to do so, or if prompted by the system’s automatic updates feature. </p><p class=\"slate-p\">Rooted or jailbroken devices pose an increased security risk, since they may allow built-in operating system restrictions to be bypassed, and introduce backdoors or additional bugs. Such devices are forbidden from being used to access TrustCloud systems.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">The employee is expected to use their devices in an ethical manner at all times, and adhere to the company’s Acceptable Use policy, as well as all policies outlined above.</p><p class=\"slate-p\"></p><div data-variable-name=\"related-controls\"></div><div data-variable-name=\"approval-log\"></div>",

All employees are required to secure their physical laptops in the following manner:</p><ul class=\"slate-ul\"><li class=\"slate-li\">The confidentiality, security and privacy of company data must be preserved, by ensuring that no unauthorized individuals may view or gain access to customer data.</li><li class=\"slate-li\"><div>While in public areas, employees are required to take appropriate safeguards when viewing customer emails and data, and to avoid discussing confidential information in person or through teleconference.</div></li><li class=\"slate-li\">End user devices containing access to internal company resources, such as laptops and cell phones, must be protected at all times and may not be left unattended. Reasonable precautions must be taken to protect company hardware, software, and information from theft and damage.</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Lost, damaged, or compromised hardware must be promptly reported.</li></ul><p class=\"slate-p\">The default, company-provided means for workforce members to connect to TrustCloud information systems leverage secure, encrypted protocols, such as SSL/TLS and SSH, as governed by TrustCloud&#x27;s Encryption Policy, and multi-factor authentication, governed by the Authentication and Password Policy. Employees must follow those established practices, and are barred from tampering or subverting them.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud provides workstations, such as laptops, for remote use. Alternatively, employees may use their own devices. In both cases, these assets and their use are subject to all TrustCloud requirements surrounding security hardening, such as installation of TrustCloud security tools, hard-disk encryption, operating system security patches, and anti-malware. Failure to adhere to those requirements is subject to the company&#x27;s disciplinary process.</p><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">Clear Desk Policy</h4><p class=\"slate-p\"> Workforce members and contractors must take measures to avoid inadvertently exposing confidential data by allowing it to be viewed by unauthorized individuals. Displays for all workstations used to access confidential data must not be viewable from outside the immediate work area. Unauthorized viewing from windows, hallways, or by employees without access rights to the same information should be avoided.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Information not in active use that is classified as confidential must not be displayed or left out in a work area. When information is not in active use, any applications displaying it on a computer should be closed. When leaving a workstation unattended, employees must ensure that its screen is locked, and that automatic screen lock settings are not relaxed. </p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Datacenters</h3><div data-control-id=\"60e8ae3e-90da-4408-8c36-1f27cc5da899\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">The capabilities of TrustCloud&#x27;s cloud infrastructure provider are summarized below.</p><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">Secure Design</h4><ul class=\"slate-ul\"><li class=\"slate-li\">Site Selection - the site is carefully selected to mitigate environmental risks, such as flooding, extreme weather, and seismic activity.</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Redundancy - data centers are designed to anticipate and tolerate failure while maintaining service levels.</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Availability - each Availability Zone is engineered to operate independently with high reliability, and zones are connected to enable easy fail-over without interruptions.</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Capacity Planning - a capacity planning model assesses infrastructure usage and demands, and supports future demand planning.</li></ul><p class=\"slate-p\"></p><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery</h4><ul class=\"slate-ul\"><li class=\"slate-li\">Business Continuity Plan - a plan outlines measures to avoid and lessen environmental disruptions, including steps to be taken before, during, and after an event.</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Pandemic Response - pandemic response policies and procedures are incorporated into disaster recovery planning.</li></ul><p class=\"slate-p\"></p><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">Physical Access</h4><ul class=\"slate-ul\"><li class=\"slate-li\">Employee Data Center Access - employees who require data center access must first provide a valid business justification.

        "description": "Define a data classification framework that can be used to determine the sensitivity of data and systems.",
        "title": "Data Classification Policy",
        "template": "<h1 class=\"slate-h1\">Data Classification Policy</h1><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Purpose</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">The purpose of this policy is to define a data classification framework that can be used to determine the sensitivity of TrustCloud&#x27;s data and systems, and to provide guidance surrounding the processes of  assigning controls to protect the data&#x27;s security, confidentiality and integrity.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Scope</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">The policy applies to all data and systems owned or operated by TrustCloud.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Ownership</h2><p class=\"slate-p\"><span data-variable-name=\"owner\"></span> is responsible for implementing and maintaining this policy.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Policy Statement</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">All TrustCloud data is valuable to the organization. However, not all information has an equal value, or requires the same level of protection. Identifying the value of information assets is key to understanding the level of security that is required to protect them. Once the appropriate level of security is identified, relevant controls can be implemented to maintain the security, confidentiality and integrity of the asset. Incorrect classification of assets may result in inadequate or incorrect controls, and inadvertent disclosure or compromise.</p><h3 class=\"slate-h3\">Data classification</h3><div data-control-id=\"1eec339d-c369-4b8c-b576-88f5e6d9cb36\"></div><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud classifies its data in four different categories: Customer Confidential, TrustCloud Restricted, TrustCloud Confidential, and Public. TrustCloud&#x27;s systems are then classified based on the classification of the data stored within them. If more than one class of data is stored on a system, the highest class determines the system&#x27;s classification. The system classification is used to assign controls to each system.</p><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">Customer Confidential</h4><p class=\"slate-p\">Customer Confidential is the highest level of data classification, and information classified as such is protected with the strictest safeguards against unauthorized disclosure or modification. The confidentiality of this data is typically required by law or customer/partner agreements, and access to it must be severely limited and based only on a clear business need.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">By default, customer data belongs in this classification. Customer data is defined as data that TrustCloud&#x27;s customers would consider themselves owners of, and would regard as their own confidential data. Typically, this data has either been sent to TrustCloud for storing or processing, or has been created as a result of using TrustCloud&#x27;s products.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Examples include:</p><li class=\"slate-li\">Operational customer data</li><li class=\"slate-li\"><div>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) belonging to TrustCloud&#x27;s customers</div></li><li class=\"slate-li\">Data subject to a confidentiality agreement with a customer, such as intellectual property or confidential communication</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Regulated data, such as electronic personal health information (ePHI)</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Credentials that can be used to access Customer Confidential data</li><p class=\"slate-p\">Compromising data that falls within this classification could expose the company to legal action. In addition, any exposure of such data could adversely affect TrustCloud customers and partners, and as a result severely damage the company&#x27;s reputation, competitive advantage, and industry confidence.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Control applicability varies by the specific type of the system, but Customer Confidential systems (sometimes referred to as \"sensitive systems\" in control language) require all available data protection controls.</p><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">TrustCloud Restricted</h4><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud Restricted data is internal to the company, and it is used to operate its business. Very few people in TrustCloud have access to TrustCloud Restricted data.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Examples include:</p><li class=\"slate-li\">Sensitive internal communication not intended for all employees, such as emails and confidential documents</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Legal documents and contractual agreements</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Employee PII</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Customer PII, further detailed below</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Private employee records, such as compensation details and performance reviews</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Customer support cases, as long as they don&#x27;t contain Customer Confidential data, whether directly embedded or as attachments</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Sensitive company intellectual property (IP)</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Credentials that can be used to access Customer Confidential data</li><p class=\"slate-p\">As mentioned above, some limited customer PII can be classified as TrustCloud Restricted. Examples includes:</p><li class=\"slate-li\">Business contact information</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Sales leads and opportunities</li><li class=\"slate-li\"><div>Confidential communication around establishing and maintaining the relationship between TrustCloud and its customers</div></li><p class=\"slate-p\">Exposure of TrustCloud Restricted data can adversely affect TrustCloud, and can result in adverse effects such as erosion of employee trust and ceding critical information beneficial to competitors. Significant exposure of employee PII could pose a legal risk.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Access to TrustCloud Restricted data should be restricted to a limited set of employees based on their role (such as Human Resources or Legal), seniority (executives), or other similar business need.</p><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">TrustCloud Confidential</h4><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud Confidential data is data internal to the company that is used to operate the business. Many people in the company have access to this data.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Examples include:</p><li class=\"slate-li\">Data in common messaging channels</li><li class=\"slate-li\">All-hands quarterly presentations</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Company policies</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Documents shared with everyone on the company&#x27;s domain</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Intellectual Property, such as source code, which is not of significant competitive advantage</li><p class=\"slate-p\">Access to some TrustCloud data and documents may be restricted, but its internal disclosure will not have any adverse impact. Examples in this category are product and engineering design documents, and product analytics data.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">TrustCloud Confidential data is intended to stay private and confidential to TrustCloud, and should not be made public. Exposure of information within this classification could result in ceding critical information beneficial to competitors, as well as erosion of employee trust.</p><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">Public</h4><p class=\"slate-p\">Public information may be disclosed to any entity or person within or outside of the company. The data may be available through a public website, and does not have confidentiality requirements.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Data owned by TrustCloud is private by default, as are the information systems storing that data. As such, most company data and systems are not classified as Public. Making data public requires an explicit authorization and publishing step by the owner of the data or the system storing it.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">As is true for any data associated with or produced by TrustCloud, the integrity of public data is an important factor that can affect the company&#x27;s reputation and brand. For example, a press release must be thoroughly vetted by TrustCloud leadership, and open source software must be properly licensed and vetted by qualified engineers to be of sufficient quality.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Examples of public data include:</p><li class=\"slate-li\">Press releases</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Sales messaging and advertising</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Reports and ebooks intended for public distribution</li><li class=\"slate-li\">Software released under an open source license</li><p class=\"slate-p\">Due to TrustCloud&#x27;s need to control and vet any publicly-available information in order to ensure its integrity, any systems hosting public data must themselves not be public. Such systems must be protected using adequate safeguards, such as strong authentication and limited access.</p><h4 class=\"slate-h4\">Data/System Ownership</h4><p class=\"slate-p\">All data and systems are required to have a designated owner. Owners are responsible for appropriately classifying their data and systems, as guided by this policy, and in coordination with the policy owner.</p><p class=\"slate-p\">Owners are stewards of the data within their purview, and do not legally own it. They are responsible for understanding the nature of the data within their system as well as the security requirements and safeguards associated with it. Owners make decisions about who will have access to the data, including administrative access.</p><div data-variable-name=\"related-controls\"></div><div data-variable-name=\"approval-log\"></div>",

Along with this policy, exists a procedur that is regularly maintained and provides detailed instructions on how the policy is followed. </p><h1 class=\"slate-h1\">General Approach</h1><p class=\"slate-p\">The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) at TrustCloud follows an agile, iterative approach that emphasizes collaboration, quality, and efficiency. The process is designed to deliver small, incremental changes that add business value, minimize risk, and ensure long-term maintainability of the product.</p><h1 class=\"slate-h1\">Phases of the SDLC</h1><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Planning</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">The development process begins with <strong class=\"slate-bold\">planning</strong> and ideation, led by Product Managers (PMs). Requirements are gathered through research, user feedback, and market analysis. Features are logged, prioritized, and tracked on a product roadmap or backlog. High-level user stories are created to define business problems, with supplementary details to provide clarity for the team. During this phase, Product Managers may collaborate with UX Designers, Engineering Leads, and QE to shape the scope of the work. Features are broken into small, manageable deliverables to ensure they can be iteratively delivered.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Design</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">During the <strong class=\"slate-bold\">design phase</strong>, teams create the artifacts needed to guide development. These include acceptance criteria, UX designs, test plans, and engineering designs. Teams work collaboratively to validate technical feasibility, identify risks, and plan for potential challenges. UX Designers develop prototypes and mocks, incorporating early feedback from engineers and QE to address feasibility, performance, and testing considerations. Engineering designs outline technical implementation details, including schema changes, API updates, security implications, and performance optimizations. This phase ensures all team members align on the implementation plan before coding begins.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Implementation</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">Once designs are finalized, development begins with a focus on delivering small, incremental changes that add business value. Engineers follow defined development standards and best practices, including writing clean, maintainable, and testable code. Code changes are developed on feature branches and submitted for review through pull requests (PRs). Each PR undergoes automated checks, including static analysis, automated tests, security audits, and dependency validation. QE collaborates with engineers to ensure automated test coverage is met, while peer code reviews validate quality, functionality, and adherence to best practices.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Testing and Quality Engineering</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">Quality Engineering (QE) is embedded throughout the development lifecycle. Quality is a shared responsibility across teams, with engineers focusing on unit and integration tests, while QE leads comprehensive end-to-end testing, exploratory testing, and other validation processes. The test plan defines responsibilities for creating and executing tests, striving for high levels of automated coverage. Testing outcomes are reviewed regularly, with any issues logged, triaged, and prioritized for resolution.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Deployment and Release</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">The organization follows a <strong class=\"slate-bold\">Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</strong> model, with deployments occurring frequently to maintain agility. Code is deployed to a staging environment for validation, where QE and engineers ensure it meets acceptance criteria and test plan requirements. Feature flags decouple deployments from user-facing releases, allowing gradual rollouts such as internal releases, beta testing, and phased external availability. Post-deployment, engineers monitor production environments for anomalies using observability tools to ensure stability.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Completion and Monitoring</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">A feature or epic is considered complete when it meets all acceptance criteria, passes testing requirements, and is validated in production. Automated test coverage must align with the test plan, and all documented issues must be reviewed and either resolved or planned for follow-up. After deployment, ongoing monitoring ensures system stability, performance, and user satisfaction. Releases are communicated internally and externally to provide transparency and clarity regarding feature availability.</p><h2 class=\"slate-h2\">Continuous Improvement</h2><p class=\"slate-p\">To ensure long-term product quality and maintainability, teams balance feature work with efforts to address technical debt, security improvements, and user experience refinements. Teams conduct regular retrospectives to identify opportunities for process improvements and optimize collaboration. This iterative approach fosters continuous learning and allows the organization to adapt effectively to changing needs.</p>",
